# Space-Environment-Project-Ada
The objective is to build a prototype for reduced onboard software for a satellite. The system
has two parts:
* A main computing hardware system that controls the main tasks.
* A microcontroller subsystem that has a direct access to the sensors and actuators.
Both subsystems communicate using a master/slave message protocol defined for this project.

The main computing hardware will be programmed using the Ada programming Language.
